# Simple Python Quiz App 🧠

This is my first Python mini-project — a basic quiz game made using input, conditionals, and simple logic.

✅ What I Learned:
- How to use `input()` and `print()`
- How to apply if/else logic
- String comparisons and basic user interaction

⚡ Built by me with Copilot’s help.

🛠️ Next Steps:
- Refactor to use loops and functions
- Add error handling and more flexible answers
